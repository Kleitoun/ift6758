## Milestone 1

### 1. Introduction

The first milestone focuses on the first two stages of the project i.e. 
* Extracting and cleaning the raw data fetched using the NHL API. 
* Analyzing this data over the seasons, using visualizations and interactive tools.

### 1.a. Project Setup

* **ift6758-project-template-main/ift6758/data/**: Contains the modules for the questions 1, 2 and 4 i.e. to retreive, download and tidy the raw data from the NHL API.
* **ift6758-project-template-main/ift6758/visualizations/**: Contains the module for question 6 that deals with the advanced visualizations using plotly.
* **ift6758-project-template-main/notebooks/**: Contains the notebooks for individual questions from 1 to 6, which in turn make use of the modules written above.

**Note:** This section assumes that one is running the codebase from the repository folder.
Instructions required for any due installations can be found [here](https://github.com/etiennedemers/ift6758/tree/master/ift6758-project-template-main#readme).

### 1.b. Blogpost Setup
