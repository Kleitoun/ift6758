## Question 1

## 1.1

<div style="text-align: justify">
The goal here is to compare the best ten goalies of the 2017-2018 season using their save percentage (SV%). The main problem is that goalies who performed well over very small sample size end up near the top of the list. Looking at the data, we see that out of the top ten goalies, seven of them had played five or less games during that season. On top of that, two others had each 17 and 32 games, which is still less than half of the regular season games (a regular season has 82 games). If a specific goalie's sample size is too small, we don't want to include him in a list of top performing goalies. One simple filter would be to only keep goalies who played in at least half of the games (i.e. GP >= 41).

<div style="text-align: justify">
We have now filtered out the goalies using our proposed approach (only keep those with GP >= 41) and have displayed them using a bar plot.

## 1.3
<div style="text-align: justify">
We are provided with advanced data that allow us to look at what are called "even strength scoring chance metrics". These statistics are used to give us more intel on the goalie's performance with regards to other metrics. <br>
First of all, there is the xGA, which is the expected number of goals allowed based on shots faced from a given location against the average shooting percentage from that location. A smaller number shows that the goalie has stopped more shots from a given location than the rest of the league. <br>
There is also the scSV%, which shows the ratio of good scoring chances stopped. A good scoring chance is a shot that has a value of 2, meaning that the shot is taken close to the goal but not right in front of it. <br>
Finally, there is the HDsc SV%, which is the ratio of high danger chances stopped. A high danger shot is one taken very close to the goalie, in front of him. Usually, these are the hardest to stop due to the velocity of the puck and often times, the presence of other players in front of the goalie, greatly reducing his vision. 

<br><br>
These three metrics, on top of the regular SV% (save percentage), constitute good indicators to determine a goalie's performance.
