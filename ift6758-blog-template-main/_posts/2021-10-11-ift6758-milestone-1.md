# Warm-up

### 1.1

<div style="text-align: justify">
The goal here is to compare the best ten goalies of the 2017-2018 season using their save percentage (SV%). The main problem is that goalies who performed well over a very small number of games end up near the top of the list. Looking at the data, we see that out of the top ten goalies, seven of them had played five or less games during that season. On top of that, two others had each 17 and 32 games, which is still less than half of the regular season games (a regular season has 82 games). If a specific goalie's sample size is too small, we don't want to include him in a list of top performing goalies. One simple filter would be to only keep goalies who played in at least half of the games (i.e. GP >= 41). 
</div>
  
### 1.2
<div style="text-align: justify">
We have now filtered out the goalies using our proposed approach (only keep those with GP >= 41) and have displayed them using a bar plot. 
</div>

### 1.3
<div style="text-align: justify">
We are provided with advanced data that allow us to look at what are called "even strength scoring chance metrics". These statistics are used to give us more intel on the goalie's performance with regards to other metrics. <br>
First of all, there is the xGA, which is the expected number of goals allowed based on shots faced from a given location against the average shooting percentage from that location. A smaller number shows that the goalie has stopped more shots from a given location than the rest of the league. <br>
There is also the scSV%, which shows the ratio of good scoring chances stopped. A good scoring chance is a shot that has a value of 2, meaning that the shot is taken close to the goal but not right in front of it. <br>
Finally, there is the HDsc SV%, which is the ratio of high danger chances stopped. A high danger shot is one taken very close to the goalie, in front of him. Usually, these are the hardest to stop due to the velocity of the puck and often times, the presence of other players in front of the goalie, greatly reducing his vision. 

<br><br>
These three metrics, on top of the regular SV% (save percentage), constitute good indicators to determine a goalie's performance.

# Data Acquisition

This section is a short tutorial on downloading the play-by-play data from both the regular seasons and the playoffs, using the NHL API.

### API Endpoint

The primary endpoint we use to fetch this data is 

```markdown
---
https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/[GAME_ID]/feed/live/
---
```
<div style="text-align: justify">
As we can see that the only argument the API inputs is the game_ID. This game_ID is a 10-digit identifier where the first 4 digits correspond to the season, next 2 digits indicate the type of the game where 02= regular season and 03=playoffs. The final 4 digits identify the specific game number. For playoff games, the 2nd digit of the specific number gives the round of the playoffs, the 3rd digit specifies the matchup, and the 4th digit specifies the game (out of 7).
    </div>

### API Requests

<div style="text-align: justify">
We use python's requests library to fetch game data for a given Game ID.
    </div>

```python
def get_file(game_id, folder_path):
    """
    Check if file is already downloaded.
        If yes, return the file path
        If not, check if it exists on the nhl api.
            If it does, save it locally and return the path
            If it doesn't, return None
    """
    
    file_path = folder_path + str(game_id) + '.json'
    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
        data = requests.get(f'https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/{game_id}/feed/live/')
        if (data.status_code == 404):
            return None
        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(data.json(), f)
            
    return file_path
```
<div style="text-align: justify">
Notice, that we're sending the request only if a JSON for the corresponding game_ID has not already been fetched.
    </div>

### Forming the Game IDs
<div style="text-align: justify">
For the regular season, the game ID has the following structue:
    </div>

```python
game_id = int(f'{season}{game_type}{game_number.zfill(4)}')
```
<div style="text-align: justify">
While for the playoffs, the logic is
</div>
```python
game_id = int(f'{season}{game_type}{playoff_round.zfill(2)}{matchup}{game_number}')
# where the game_number is out of 7
```

<div style="text-align: justify">
Finally,
We then iterate over the game numbers to form game_IDs as required and fetch the live data using the API endpoint.
To enable analysis on this data and avoid redundant calls to the API, we dump the result into an individual JSON each time.
    </div>

# Interactive Debugging tool

<div style="text-align: justify">
Our debugging tool allows us to look at every event of every game of every season. <br>
First we select a specific season and wether we want the regular or playoff games. <br>
</div>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xGbo4q4zqunCfc7PKB" width="480" height="70" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/xGbo4q4zqunCfc7PKB"></a></p>

Then, we select which confrontation we want by selecting the home team and the away team. <br>

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/lXL2f7z4saxIzvdQXF" width="480" height="38" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/lXL2f7z4saxIzvdQXF"></a></p>

Since each confrontation can happen multiple times, we select the game we want from the available games.

We then get a summary of the game.

After that, we can look at all the events of the specific game.

# Tidy Data

### 4.1
![image](./figures/question_4_1.png)

### 4.2

<div style="text-align: justify">
By looking at the 'Penalty' and 'Goal' events we can logically deduce the strength at any given time in the game (by looking at penalty times, goals, etc). For example, a minor penalty usually lasts 2 minutes, unless the opposing team scores a goal, in which case it ends early. We can use this logic (along with some manipulations related to period number and time) to build a table which contains the strength at every second of each game. Then, when we have the events data, we can get the strengh for each event by joining that table. See screenshot of cell below for sample penalty event: 
    </div>

![image](./figures/question_4_2.png)

### 4.3

<div style="text-align: justify">
Based on coordinates, it is possible to classify shots as low/high danger or as coming from a particular zone. For example, a shot and/or goal can most likely be classified as a rebound if there was another shot from the same team made less than x seconds prior (not a hundred percent accurate). However, if we were to classify a shot as off the rush, there isn't much. information. to reliably do it. <br>
    We have a set of events below: <br><br> {'Blocked Shot', 'Faceoff', 'Game End', 'Game Official', 'Game Scheduled', 'Giveaway', 'Goal', 'Hit', 'Missed Shot', 'Penalty', 'Period End', 'Period Official', 'Period Ready', 'Period Start', 'Shot', 'Stoppage', 'Takeaway'}<br><br>
    Any of these can be considered in order to create additional features. 
                                                                                                      </div>

# Simple Visualizations

### 5.1 

<div style="text-align: justify">
When looking at our barplot, it is clear that the most common type of shot is the wrist shot. It is shot that doesn't require a wind-up since the stick is often directly in contact with the puck. Other type of shots either have  a greater wind-up, require more ice space or are specific shots (deflections, tip-ins). The most dangerous shot is the one that has the highest conversion rate ; from the graph only, the tip-in seems to be the most dangerous one.
    </div>

![image](./figures/question_5_1.png)

### 5.2 
<div style="text-align: justify">
We have plotted the shot conversion rate (shot percentage) and the number of shots taken (sample size) for each season from 2018-2019 to 2020-2021. <br>
First, we can look at the shot percentage. It seems to be consistent every season ; the greater the distance, the smaller the conversion rate. We can note that shots taken the furthest away possible from the net have a little higher conversion rate; most probably due to deflections. The real changes happen in the shots taken. In season 2018-19, we see that more shots are taken the closer the players are to the net. However, the next season, in 2019-20, player started taking shots from afar way more often while other shots were almost as frequent. During that season, we can observe a huge spike in shots taken from afar, a potential result of gameplay change. Finally, in season 2020-21, players started taking shots from different distances more frequently. We can observe a more regular pattern in the shots taken in that season.
    </div>

### 5.3

<div style="text-align: justify">
    The following plot shows the shot percentage (the amount of goals scored per shots taken) with regards to the distance to the net, for every type of shot, during the 2020-2021 season. It is clear that, for most shots, the further away you are, the less is the shot percentage. However, we can see that deflected shots and tip-ins have a high shot percentage since the distance at which those shots are taken is relatively small. Yet, they have a high goal percentage from 10% to almost 30% for the deflected shots and from 15% to 25% for the tip-in. These shots can be considered the most dangerous: impredictable, short range and fast; making it harder for the goalie to stop them.
    </div>

# Advanced Visualizations

The following interactive plot shows the excess shots pr hours per 100sqft per team per season relative to the league average for that specific season.

{% include question_6_shotmap.html %}

### 6.2
<div style="text-align: justify">
        These plots and shotmaps allow us to get a visual distribution of areas the teams shoot, which in turn aid understanding the regions from which a team generates more or less than or equal to the league average rate of shots.<br><br>
These plots allow us to have a better understanding of a team's offensive mentality as well as their preferred hitting spots. The team could derive better offensive strategies to increase the shot-to-goal ratio. Are players hitting too much from the backline? Do they have the right players with the right skillsets to play that way? Or else, they could use those plots to improve after an offensive drough. Are the players taking randoms shots? Do they have issues breaking in the opposition's defence? <br>  
On another hand, other teams could use this information to adapt their defensive positioning and strategies. Are the offensive players taking less shots? Should the defence focusing on outside shots? <br><br>
If observed over the seasons, the shotmaps can be very useful to understand the changing strategies of various teams. It also allows us to partly reason the standings of the teams.
</div>



### 6.3

<div style="text-align: justify">
It is very evident from the standings that the performance had drastically improved between these two seasons.<br>
From the shot map of Colorado Avalanche of 2016-17 season, we see that they have lesser shots than the league average in most of the areas and even lesser number of shots than league average from the area in front of the net, while it is the easiest to score from this area, in general. The areas where they have more shots than league average are near the boards and the blue line, which are the areas where it is usually harder to score from. This is indicative of a weak offensive team, which aligns with the fact that they finished last in the league that season with the least amount of goals scored (only 166) in the whole league. <br><br>
    </div>

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Shotmap of the Colorado Avalanches during the 2016-2017 season</i></div><br><br>
    
<div style="text-align: justify">
Fast forward to the 2020-2021 season, we see that the Colorado Avalanches finished first of their division with the highets number of goals scored in the whole league (197). Their shotmap plot shows a large amount of shots taken, especially in front the net, as well as the last third of the ice rink. We can deduce that they have grealty improved their offense strategy - mainly their shot selection - which lead them to that first position.
</div>

### 6.4

<div style="text-align: justify">
Based upon the shot maps and the play-by-play data, we can often analyze the regions that are slightly favourable for a good shot. In front of the net, is one such regions. But in most of these seasons, the Buffalo Sabres had less shots than league average from in front of the net, while the Tampa Bay Lightning had more shots than league average from in front of the net.<br>
This can be one of the potential reasons for Lightning’s success and the Sabres’ struggles.<br><br>

Of course, it is one of the many factors that effect the overall win of a team. Factors like goalie's performance, shot maps accompanied by the other play data such as the angle of the shot(which in turn help calculating the advanced metrics such as xG: Expected Goals); also help determine what helped or what did not work well for a team.
