# Question 2

### 2.1

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Histograms of shot counts with respect to their distance to the net(goals on top and no-goals at the bottom)</i></div><br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
    We have displayed histograms of the shot counts from the 2015/16 to the 2018/19 seasons with regards to their distance to the net. We can see that the further away players are, the less likely their shots are to convert into goals. This can be explained by the presence of defenders blocking their vision/their shots, by the reduced precision of their shot due to the distance or by the increased time the goalie has to block the shot.

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Histograms of shots with respect to the shot angle to the net (goals on top and no-goals at the bottom)</i></div><br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
    We have displayed histograms of the shot counts from the 2015/16 to the 2018/19 seasons with regards to the shot angle to the net. We can see that most of the goals are scored straight to the net (~0° angle to the net). However, most of the shots are also taken at 30° (+/- 5) angle, on either side of the net. Most offensive plays come from the side of the rink where players try to cut to the middle in order to get a better shot, which can explain the high proportion of shots taken at those angles.

<div style="text-align: justify">
    Looking at the 2D histogram, we see that the further away we are from the net the closer, the less shots are taken at a big angle. Yet, closer shots taken at almost a 90° degree angle are more likely to be converted into goals, which can seem contradictory since the attacker has less options to shoot.

### 2.2

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Graphs relating goal rate and shot distance and relating goal rate and shot angle</i></div><br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
    These two plots confirm our previous observations. Most shots that convert to goals are closer to the net and/or taken at a small angle with respect to the net. We can observe that some shots convert to goals when taken at the greatest distance possible: usually, when teams are behind in score towards the end of the game, they will sub out their goalie in order to have an additional player on the rink - this gives the opportunity to the other team to shot in the empty from their zone.

## 2.3

<div style="text-align: justify">
    The two histograms show the proportion of goals scored on empty and non-empty nets. The clear difference that is observable is the distance at which empty nets goals are scored compared to non-empty nets goals. Most goals that are scored on non-empty goals are relatively close to the net - as discussed earlier, the presence of the goalie makes it harder to score from afar. However,  when the nets are empty, the offensive team has more options and can choose to shoot at the net from almost anywhere on the rink.

# Question 3

## 3.1

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Heatmap of predictions on the validation set from the logistic regression trained using only the distance feature</i></div><br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
    Is it clear from the heatmap generated that the logistic regression model didn't properly classify every datapoint. Even though the accuracy was of 90%, there aren't any shots that were classified as goals, resulting in a bad representation of the dataset. This can be explained by the high level of imbalance in our dataset - out of all the shots taken, only a small proportion of them get converted into goals.
